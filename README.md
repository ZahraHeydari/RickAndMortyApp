## 🧱 Project Structure
The project follows a modular Clean Architecture structure:

### RickAndMortyApp/
#### ├── app/ -----------------------> Main application module
#### ├── presentation/ --------------> UI Layer (Jetpack Compose, ViewModels, Navigation)
#### ├── domain/ --------------------> Business Logic Layer (Use Cases, Models)
#### ├── data/ ----------------------> Data Layer (Repositories, API Services)


### Module Responsibilities
- **:presentation:** Handles all UI, state management, and navigation. Depends on the `:domain` module.
- **:domain:** Pure Kotlin module — defines business logic, models, and repository interfaces. No Android dependencies.
- **:data:** Implements repositories and manages API/network communication (and future database integration).
